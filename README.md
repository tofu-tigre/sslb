# A Stupidly Simple Load Balancer (SSLB)
*Created by Jaeden Quintana*

A simple load balancer which handles incoming HTTP requests and redirects their traffic
to a registered endpoint.

## How to Use
The executable reads a TOML file named "sslb.toml" which contains the configuration
for the load balancer. More documentation soon!

## Supported Policies
* Round-robin
